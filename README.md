# Real-time chat app
Hello! Welcome to my second project, a real-time chat application. The application supports group chats, private messages, file uploading, chat deletion, and adding new users.

The front end uses ReactJS and the Pretty Chat Window component, and the back end is powered by NodeJS. HTTP requests are managed with Axios, and the server is set up using Express. The API I used is from chatengine.io; following their guide to creating the app.

Thank you for checking out my project!
